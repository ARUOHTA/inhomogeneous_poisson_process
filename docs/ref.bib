               mixture of Dirichlet process model. Recent attention has focused
               on retention of the random distribution function in the model,
               but sampling algorithms have then suffered from the countably
               infinite representation these distributions have. The key to the
               algorithm detailed in this article, which also keeps the random
               distribution functions, is the introduction of a latent variable
               which allows a finite number, which is known, of objects to be
               sampled within each iteration of a Gibbs sampler.",

               strawberries, wheat, other foodstuffs, and Cadillacs. Given the
               other inputs I could demonstrate computer printouts of circularly
               arranged optimal land uses, and could even run the program with
               multiple market places to get mixtures of partially concentric
               patterns, and could include a climatic gradient to get
               non-circular patterns. All this was done off-line, in a batch
               environment (circa 1965). My computer program could not
               incorporate positional variations in transportation cost, even
               though Von Thunen himself gave such a demonstration introducing a
               river into the geographic space (Figure I). Several GISs can now
               provide more realistic calculations. One of our graduate
               students, R. Dodson, has implemented the Von Thunen model within
               the IDRISI system, and has done some work on an implementation of
               the Weber model. This system allows variable transportation costs
               to be included. However he still uses synthetic landscapes.",

                   $\mathbb{R}^{p}$ observed at irregularly spaced locations in
                   $R_{n} =[0,A_{n}]^{d} \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}$. We first
                   derive the uniform convergence rate of general kernel
                   estimators, followed by the asymptotic normality of an
                   estimator for the mean function of the model. Moreover, we
                   consider additive models to avoid the curse of dimensionality
                   arising from the dependence of the convergence rate of
                   estimators on the number of covariates. Subsequently, we
                   derive the uniform convergence rate and joint asymptotic
                   normality of the estimators for additive functions. We also
                   introduce approximately $m_{n}$-dependent RFs to provide
                   examples of LSRFs. We find that these RFs include a wide
